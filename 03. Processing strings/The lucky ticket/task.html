<h2>The lucky ticket</h2>
<p>Paul loves to ride public transport and after receiving a ticket, he immediately checks whether he got a lucky one. A
    ticket is considered a lucky one if the sum of the first three numbers of this ticket matches the sum of the last
    three numbers.</p>

<p>However, Paul does not count well in his head. That is why he asks you to write a program which will check the
    equality of the sums and display "Lucky" if the sums match, and "Regular" if the sums differ.</p>

<p>A string of six digits is provided as input to the program.</p>

<p>You need to print out only the word <strong>"Lucky"</strong> or <strong>"Regular"</strong> with a capital letter
    (without quotes).</p>

<button onclick="getElementById('hint-678').style.display='inline'">
    Hint
</button>
<div id="hint-678" style="display:none;">
    <p>To get the <code>int</code> value that the character actually represents, you can use the
        <code>Character.getNumericValue()</code> method
    </p>
    <pre><code>char charValue = '2';
int intValue = Character.getNumericValue(charValue); // 2</code>
    </pre>

    <p>This is an incorrect way to get the <code>int</code> value:</p>
    <code>int intValue = (int) charValue; // 50, which is the ASCII code for character ‘2’</code>
