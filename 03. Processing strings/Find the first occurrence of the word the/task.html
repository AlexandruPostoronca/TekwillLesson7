<h2>Find the first occurrence of the word "the"</h2>
<p>Write a program that takes a sentence as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of the word "<strong>the" </strong>(can
    be part of a word), regardless of the capitalization. If there is no occurrence of it, it must output -1.</p>
<p>For instance, if the sentence is <strong>“The apple is red.”</strong> the output should be 0, if the sentence is
    <strong>“I ate the red apple.”</strong> the output should be 6, and if the sentence is <strong>“I love
        apples.”</strong> the output should be -1.</p>
<p>Note, <strong>the</strong> and <strong>The</strong> are equal.</p>


<div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>The apple is red.
</pre>
    <p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>0</pre>
</div>
<div><p><strong> Sample Input 2: </strong></p>
    <pre>I ate the red apple.
</pre>
    <p><strong> Sample Output 2: </strong></p>
    <pre>6</pre>
</div>
