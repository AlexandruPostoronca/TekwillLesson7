<h2>Generating passwords</h2>
<p>A password is hard to crack if it contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits and consists of exactly N symbols. Also, a password cannot contain two or more of the same characters in a row.</p>

<p>For the given numbers A, B, C, and N, you should output a password that matches these requirements.<br>
<br>
It is guaranteed that A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers, and A + B + C &lt;= N. Keep in mind that any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>3 2 3 10</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>ABAab121AB</pre></div>
