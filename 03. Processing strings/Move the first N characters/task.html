<h2>Move the first N characters</h2>
<div>Write a program that reads a string <b>s</b> and an int <b>n</b>, and then moves the first <b>n</b> characters of
    <b>s</b> to the end of the string. The program must output the changed string. If <b>n</b> is greater than the
    length of the string, it must output the string unchanged.
</div>

<div>Note, the <code>substring</code> method can help you, but you may choose another way to solve the
    problem.
</div>
<p><b>Input data format</b></p>
<p>The single input line contains <b>s </b>and <b>n</b> separated by a space.</p>

<div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>Hello 3
</pre>
    <p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>loHel</pre>
</div>
