<h2>Compression algorithm</h2>
<p>Upon learning that DNA is not a random string, freshmen of the Bioinformatics Institute from the informatics group suggested using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.</p>

<p>Encoding is performed as follows:<br>
The string <strong>"aaaabbсaa"</strong> is converted into <strong>"a4b2с1a2"</strong>, that is, the groups of the same characters of the input string are replaced by the symbol and the number of its repetitions in this string.</p>

<p>Write a program, which reads the string, encodes it by this algorithm and outputs the encoded sequence. The encoding must be case sensitive.</p>

<p>Note, string can contain only a single character.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>aaaabbcaa</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>a4b2c1a2</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 2: </strong></p><pre>abc</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 2: </strong></p><pre>a1b1c1</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 3: </strong></p><pre>aaaaa</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 3: </strong></p><pre>a5</pre></div>
