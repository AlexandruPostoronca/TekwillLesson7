<h2>Create an euphonious word</h2>
<p>All the letters of the English alphabet are divided into vowels and consonants.<br>
The vowels are: a, e, i, o, u, y.<br>
The remaining letters are consonants.<br>
<br>
A word is considered euphonious (pleasant-sounding) if it doesn't have three or more vowels or consonants in a row. Otherwise, it is considered discordant (harsh-sounding).<br>
<br>
Your task is to create euphonious words from discordant. You can insert any letters inside the word. You should output the minimum number of characters needed to create a euphonious word from a given word.<br>
<br>
For example, the word "schedule" is considered discordant because it has three consonants "sch" in a row. To create a euphonious word you need to add any vowel between 's' and 'c' or between 'c' and 'h'.</p><div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p><pre>schedule</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p><pre>1</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 2: </strong></p><pre>garage</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 2: </strong></p><pre>0</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 3: </strong></p><pre>player</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 3: </strong></p><pre>1</pre></div><div><p><strong> Sample Input 4: </strong></p><pre>biiiiig</pre><p><strong> Sample Output 4: </strong></p><pre>2</pre></div>
