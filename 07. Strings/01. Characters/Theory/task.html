<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>The <code>char</code> type is used to represent letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols.
    Each character is just a symbol enclosed in single quotes.</p>
<pre><code>char lowerCaseLetter = 'a';
char upperCaseLetter = 'Q';
char number = '1';
char space = ' ';
char dollar = '$';</code></pre>
<p>This type can represent all characters in all languages as well as some special and computer symbols. It corresponds
    to the <strong>Unicode</strong> (UTF-16) format. Unicode is a computer encoding methodology that assigns a unique
    number for every character. It doesn't matter what language, or computer platform it's on. This is important in a
    global, networked world, and for computer systems that must accommodate multiple languages and special characters.
    Unicode truly unifies all of these into a single standard.</p>

<h4>Initializing characters with codes</h4>
<p>A character can be also created using its hexadecimal code in <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/"
                                                                    rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
    Unicode table</a>. The code starts with <code>\u</code>.</p>
<pre><code>char ch = '\u0040'; // it represents '@'
System.out.println(ch); // @</code></pre>
<p>Although we use a sequence of characters to represent such a code, the code represents exactly one character.</p>
<p>As an example, capital Latin letters have hexadecimal codes from <code>'\u0041'</code> to <code>'\u005A'</code>, and
    small Latin letters have codes from <code>'\u0061'</code> to <code>'\u007A'</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>char</code> type has a minimum value encoded as <code>'\u0000'</code> and the maximum value encoded as
    <code>'\uffff'</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to initialize a char with a positive integer number.</p>
<pre><code>char ch = 64;
System.out.println(ch); // @</code></pre>
<p>The number <code>64</code> just corresponds to the Unicode hexadecimal code <code>'\u0040'</code>.</p>
<p>Any <code>char</code> variable may be considered as an unsigned integer value in the range from 0 to 65535.</p>

<h4>Retrieving subsequent characters</h4>
<p>There are two operators for adding (<code>+</code>) and subtracting (<code>-</code>) integer numbers in order to get
    the next and previous character according to the Unicode order.</p>
<pre><code>char ch = 'b';
ch += 1; // 'c'
ch -= 2; // 'a'</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to add or subtract two characters.</p>
<pre><code>char ch = 'b';
ch += 'a';
ch -= 'b';
System.out.println(ch); // prints 'a' without quotes</code></pre>
<p>Actually, these operations manipulate with codes of characters, <code>'b'</code> has the next code after
    <code>'a'</code>.</p>
<p>It is possible to use increment (<code>++</code>) and decrement (<code>--</code>) operators in prefix and postfix
    forms.</p>
<pre><code>char ch = 'A';
ch += 10;
System.out.println(ch);   // 'K'
System.out.println(++ch); // 'L'
System.out.println(++ch); // 'M'
System.out.println(--ch); // 'L'</code></pre>

<h4>Escape sequences</h4>
<p>There are some special characters starting with a backslash <code>\</code> which are known as the escape or control
    sequences. They do not have corresponding symbols and cannot be found on a keyboard. To represent such characters we
    use a pair of regular symbols. In a program, this pair will be considered as exactly one character with the
    appropriate code. </p>
<ul>
    <li><code>'\n'</code> is the newline character;</li>
    <li><code>'\t'</code> is the tab character;</li>
    <li><code>'\r'</code> is the carriage return character;</li>
    <li><code>'\\'</code> is the backslash character itself;</li>
    <li><code>'\''</code> is the single quote mark;</li>
    <li><code>'\"'</code> is the double quote mark.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are several examples:</p>
<pre><code>System.out.print('\t'); // makes a tab
System.out.print('a');  // prints 'a'
System.out.print('\n'); // goes to the new line
System.out.print('c');  // prints 'c'</code></pre>
<p>This code prints:</p>
<pre><code>  a
c</code></pre>


<div>There is also a character to represent a single space <code>' '</code>. It is just a regular character, not an
    escape sequence.
